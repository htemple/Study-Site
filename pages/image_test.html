         <h2>JPGs</h2>
         
         <p>JPG images are good for photos, but they can't handle transparency! Use a .png instead maybe.</p>
         
         <img src='../images/mochi.jpg' alt="What a cute lil dude! What's your favorite jpeg?"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Animations: <strong>NO</strong></li>
            <li>Transparency: <strong>NO</strong></li>
            <li>Color pallete: <strong>LIMITED</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
         <h2>GIFs</h2>

        <p>GIFs are good for animations. Their pixels are either transparent or not, binary style. Their color pallete is also limited, making <em>photos</em> <strong>NOT</strong> a good idea.</p>

        <img src='../images/mochi-gif.gif' alt="Notice that the gif is aligned weird...."/>
        <ul>
            <li>Animations: <strong>YES</strong></li>
            <li>Transparency: <strong>BINARY</strong></li>
            <li>Color pallete: <strong>LIMITED</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>PNGs</h2>

        <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons. They are bigger than a jpg, but hold the same quality to the naked eye. However, they don't have color problems and can handle transparency!</p>

        <img src='../images/mochi-png.png' alt="Nice and clean!"/>
            <ul>
                <li>Animations: <strong>NO</strong></li>
                <li>Transparency: <strong>FULL SPECTRUM</strong></li>
                <li>Color pallete: <strong>FULL</strong></li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <p>SVGs are Scalable Vector Graphics files. They can scale up or down without losing quality. In other words, you won't see any nasty pixels when making the image bigger.
            They are good to use whenever you can, but be wary of file sizes. They are best for nice graphics or logos. </p>
            <p>Here it's big! 400x400 pixels</p>
            <img src='../images/archery.svg' width="400" height="400" alt="Sample SVG! Yay big archery!!"/>
            <p>Here it's small! 75x75 pixels</p>
            <img src='../images/archery.svg' width="75" height="75" alt="Sample SVG! Yay small archery!!"/>
            <p><strong>Dey <em>look</em> de sayme!</strong>They are twins!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Animations: <strong>NO</strong></li>
                <li>Transparency: <strong>FULL SPECTRUM</strong></li>
                <li>Color pallete: <strong>FULL</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Extra note: 
                There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size.
